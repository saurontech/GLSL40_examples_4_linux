#### REQUIREMENTS #######

This code is written against the Qt SDK version 4.7.  It includes
a qmake project file, so building the examples should be
very straightforward as long as you have the Qt SDK installed.
It should also load into Qt Creator quite readily.

The examples have been tested in Windows, but not on other OSs.
It should be fairly straightforward to port over to Linux or
MacOS X, so any help with this would be appreciated.

###### RUNNING THE EXAMPLES #########

Each example is broken up into a class that extends Scene.  Each
one should have a class name that begins with "Scene".  There is not
a one-to-one correspondence between recipes and scenes so
you may need to look around a bit to find the example.  To select one
of the scenes, edit the file mainview.cpp and change
the line that starts with:

scene = new Scene....(...);

with the appropriate scene class.  For example, if I want
to run the ScenePcf example, I'd use the following:

scene = new ScenePcf();

Also, you will need to update the include statement at the
top of the file:

#include "scenepcf.h"
